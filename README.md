Efficiently manage data with C# collection classes. In this course, join Joe Marini as he details how to maintain collections of data in C# and choose the right collection class to apply to a wide set of programming scenarios. Joe begins by covering basic concepts, including the difference between generic and non-generic collections and how to select a collection class to suit a specific programming problem. He then goes over basic collection classes, including how to use a LinkedList, and discusses specialized collections such as OrderDictionary and StringCollection.
